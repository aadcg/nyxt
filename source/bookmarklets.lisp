;;;; This package and file serves as a source for bookmarklets that
;;;; originate outside of the Nyxt codebase. Eventually, the goal is
;;;; to translate these bookmarklets into their equivalent parenscript
;;;; forms for easier interaction and editing.

;;;; The Bookmarklets in this file are copyright Jesse Ruderman and
;;;; are released into the public domain, per the license available
